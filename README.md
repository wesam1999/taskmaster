## how it is works
Homepage
The main page  be modified to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. <br />
When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.<br />
<br />
The homepage also contain a button to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.<br />
Add a Task<br />
On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.<br />

All Tasks<br />
The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.<br />
Task Detail Page<br />
 It  have a title at the top of the page, and a Lorem Ipsum description.<br />

Settings Page<br />
